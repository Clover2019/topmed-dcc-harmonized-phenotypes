  "dcc_harmonization_comments": "This variable was harmonized by converting the component study variables to the appropriate unit of measure as needed and, when possible, accounting for measurements outside an assay's limits of detection (LOD). If the information was available, measurements below the lower limit of detection (LLOD) were set to the LLOD and measurements above the upper limit of detection (ULOD) were set to the ULOD unless otherwise indicated in the study-specific sections below. Some studies identified subjects with measurements outside the LOD; see table below for more details. The assay(s) used to measure 8-epi-PGF2a concentration differed by study and/or subcohort.\n\n#### FHS\n\nThe *_FHS_* Offspring Cohort included a variable on dbGaP (phv00023802) indicating which lot the ELISA test was from. Lot differences in 8-epi-PGF2a concentrations were observed after adjusting for age and sex. \n\nThe *_FHS_* Original and New Offspring Spouse Cohorts are not included in this harmonized phenotype at this time.\n\n#### Exam visit for 8-epi-PGF2a measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Visit |\n|---------|----------|\n| FHS_Offspring | Exam 7 |\n| FHS_Gen3 | Exam 1 |\n| FHS_Omni1 | Exam 3 |\n| FHS_Omni2 | Exam 1 |\n\n#### Assay and limits of detection for 8-epi-PGF2a measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Assay | LLOD | ULOD^1^ | Differentiated^2^ |\n|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| FHS _Offspring | ELISA | 3.0 pg/mL | 500 pg/mL  | No |\n| FHS_Gen3 | ELISA | 0.8 pg/mL | 500 pg/mL | No |\n| FHS_Omni1 | ELISA | 2.7 pg/mL | 500 pg/mL  | No |\n| FHS_Omni2 | ELISA | 0.8 pg/mL | 500 pg/mL | No |\n\n1.

If \"Yes\", measurements outside the LOD can be identified using component study or subcohort variables.\n\n#### Specimen type for 8-epi-PGF2a measurements\n\nTable includes studies or subcohorts with known specimen types only.\n\n| Study or subcohort | Specimen |\n|---------|----------|\n| FHS | Urine |\n",
