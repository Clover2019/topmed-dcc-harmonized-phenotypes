If the information was available, measurements below the lower limit of detection (LLOD) were set to the LLOD and measurements above the upper limit of detection (ULOD) were set to the ULOD unless otherwise indicated in the study-specific sections below. Some studies identified subjects with measurements outside the LOD; see table below for more details. The assay(s) used to measure E-selectin concentration from serum or plasma differed by study and/or subcohort.\n\n#### MESA\n\nThe *_MESA_* Family Cohort is not included in this harmonized phenotype at this time.\n\n#### Exam visit for E-selectin measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Visit |\n|---------|----------|\n| MESA_Classic | Exam 1 Main |\n| MESA_AirNR | AirNR Exam Main | \n\n#### Assay and limits of detection for E-selectin measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Assay | LLOD | ULOD^1^ | Differentiated^2^ |\n|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| MESA_Classic | ELISA |  0.1 ng/mL | NA  | No |\n| MESA_AirNR | ELISA | 0.47 ng/mL | 100 ng/mL | Yes |\n\n1.
