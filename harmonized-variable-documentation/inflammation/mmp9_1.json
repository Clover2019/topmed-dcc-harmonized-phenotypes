If the information was available, measurements below the lower limit of detection (LLOD) were set to the LLOD and measurements above the upper limit of detection (ULOD) were set to the ULOD unless otherwise indicated in the study-specific sections below. Some studies identified subjects with measurements outside the LOD; see table below for more details. The assay(s) used to measure MMP9 concentration from serum or plasma differed by study and/or subcohort.\n\n#### MESA \n\nThe *_MESA_* Family and AirNR Cohorts are not included in this harmonized phenotype at this time.\n\n#### Exam visit for MMP9 measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Visit |\n|---------|----------|\n| MESA_Classic | Exam 1 Main |\n\n#### Assay and limits of detection for MMP9 measurements\n\n| Study or subcohort | Assay | LLOD | ULOD^1^ | Differentiated^2^ |\n|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| MESA_Classic | ELISA | 12 ng/mL  | 800 ng/mL | No |\n\n1.
