# JSON documentation for TOPMed DCC-harmonized variables

All information necessary to reproduce a harmonized variable is available in a single JSON document file.
These files are located in dataset-specific subdirectories.
For example, the JSON documents for variables in the blood pressure dataset (`antihypertensive_meds_1.json`, `bp_diastolic_1.json`, `bp_systolic_1.json`) are located in the `blood_pressure` subdirectory.
